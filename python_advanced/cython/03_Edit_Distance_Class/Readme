How to compile cython files:


1. Create a .pyx file with the cython code (Edit_Distance_c.pyx)

2. Create a compile.py file as the one in this folder

3. From a terminal run:
   python3 compile.py build_ext --inplace 

   Some files will be created in the same folder as the .pyx file

4. Move the file with extension  .cpython-37m-x86_64-linux-gnu to the folder where you have your main notebook (and will import the compiled module)

5. Import it as usual: from Edit_Distance_c import Edit_Distance_c
